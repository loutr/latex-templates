# latex-math-documents

This repository aims to help other **LaTeX** users in their research of producing specific scientific documents (with more complex *TikZ* figures for instance).  I am the author of the documents unless specified otherwise. So far, all documents are written in French.  Any suggestion or pull request would be happily welcome.

## To-do list:

* Open a new branch to upload an English version of each document.
* Add smaller documents featuring a documentation file to provide minimalist examples.
* Correct and optimize certain files.

## About
This documents were NOT made by a professional, and I do not guarantee they were written in the most efficient way.
Folders are named after the class in which the documents were created. `'filename'.source` contains file-related documents, such as images used in it, the exercise's questions, etc. 'DM' stands for homework *("Devoir Ã  la Maison")*.
