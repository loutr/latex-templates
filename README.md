# latex-templates

This repository is a collection of **LaTeX** documents I have written over the years.  So far, they are all written in French.  Feel free to suggest anything _via_ pull requests.

## To-do list:

* Open a new branch to upload an English version of each document;
* Optimisation and potential bugfixes;
* Complete overhaul, with a focus on providing only templates (`.sty` files) and minimal working examples.

## About
I am the author of these documents, unless specified otherwise.
Folders are named after the class for which the documents were created. `'filename'.source` contains file-related documents, such as figures, exercise's questions, etc. 'DM' stands for homework *("Devoir Ã  la Maison")*.
