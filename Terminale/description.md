### Description of this directory

#### DM05
This document is about finding a certain geometrical interpretation to a sequence of complex numbers.
Here can be found a `verbatim` environment and a graph made to plot the sequence with other details.

#### DM07
This one is about using (implicitly) the Riemann rectangle approximation on an integral that was supposed to be  unsolvable by the students (integration by parts is studied a bit later).
I made here several graphs representing the rectangles getting ever closer to the real curve of the function.
