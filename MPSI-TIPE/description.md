### Description of this directory

**TIPE** is the name of a nation-wide school project every French student must prepare as an oral test to enter an engineering school.  This project was made as a dummy test and is therefore not finished.  The following project is a draft for a neural-network-based computer sight algorithm used to recognise a fish and its species.
