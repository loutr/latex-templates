### Description of this directory

#### DM1
A homework made of two separate exercises:
- One about a specific sequence, the proof for the existence of its limit and the computation of the latter;
- The other comprises a sequence of differential equations, whose solutions are then studied to find their zeros.
This production contains denser lines of equations, a plot of the function and what is called a *variation table ("tableau de variations")*, which is a useful way of representing the variations of a real-valued function.

#### DM3
A homework made of two separate exercises:
- The first one is the study of a complex-valued function;
- The second one is the research of a solution of a specific differential equation.

#### DM5
This homework is about finding expressions for the [Wallis' integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis%27_integrals).

#### DM6
A homework made of two separate exercises:
- The first deals with the computation of a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) for the __tangent__ function;
- The second is the study of a certain function.
This production contains writing of multiple Taylor series, a function graph and other variation tables.

#### DM8
The purpose of this homework is to prove Euler constant's irrationality. It contains nothing but lots of mathematical expressions and written reasoning.

#### DM9
A homework made of two separate exercises:
- The first one is the study of a certain function;
- The other is an exercise about prime numbers.
It contains function graph, a big (!) variation table and regular arrays.

#### DM11
About solving the [Basel problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem), using Chebyshev polynomials.

#### DM15
A problem of probability.

#### DM18
A homework presenting various possibilities to find an expression for the determinant of [Circulant matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulant_matrix).
